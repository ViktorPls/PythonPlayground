Pequeños programas para testear ideas

El libro First Year in Code de Isaac Lyman dice lo siguiente:
> With programming, you can write small programs to test your ideas. I highly recommend creating a
coding playground folder. Any time you are trying to understand something, create a small example
program to test it out in your playground. You can also come up with larger projects to work on.
Such larger projects will force you out of the tidy confines of well-defined exercises. You’ll need to
integrate disparate areas of knowledge and think creatively to make your way around roadblocks.

Esta es la idea llevada a la practica :)
